Hello! 
I'm Guy Schndrig, a data scientist at the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office ([FSVO](https://www.blv.admin.ch/blv/en/home.html)), where I work in the Data Competence Center (DCC). 
My work focuses on analysing the [use of antibiotics in animals](https://www.blv.admin.ch/blv/de/home/tiere/tierarzneimittel/antibiotika/isabv.html) and providing specialized data science solutions to the FSVO.

Previously, I worked as a researcher at the [Veterinary Public Health Institute](https://vphi.unibe.ch/) at the [University of Bern](https://www.unibe.ch/index_eng.html) and as a scientific officer in the specialist unit for veterinary medicines (FSVO). I studied biology (specializing in genetics and biostatistics) at the [Institute of Ecology and Evolution](https://www.iee.unibe.ch/), University of Bern. During my studies, I had the opportunity to work with [Laurent Excoffier](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=VsaRrjsAAAAJ&hl=en), [Stephan Peischl](https://scholar.google.at/citations?user=RwD5PKEAAAAJ&hl=de), and [Gerald Heckel](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=Iy385VIAAAAJ&hl=de), researching the population genetics of Tula hantavirus in _Microtus arvalis_. 

I earned my Ph.D. Biomedical Sciences from the University of Bern, under the supervision of [Gertraud Regula-Sch√ºpbach](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QJoRL70AAAAJ&hl=en), further deepening my expertise in epidemiology and public health.
