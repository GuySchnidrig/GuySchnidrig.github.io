In this paper we present a method for the detection of anomalies in the Swiss antibiotic prescription monitoring system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="anomaly_pic" src="images/FigureAnomaly.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibiotic resistance is one of the major concerns in veterinary and human medicine and poses a considerable threat to both human and animal health. It has been shown that over- or misuse of antibiotics is one of the primary drivers of antibiotic resistance. To develop the surveillance of antibiotic use, Switzerland introduced the "Informationssystem Antibiotika in der Veterinärmedizin" (IS ABV) in 2019, mandating electronic registration of antibiotic prescriptions by all veterinarians in Switzerland. However, initial data analysis revealed a considerable amount of implausible data entries, potentially compromising data quality and reliability. These anomalies may be caused by input errors, inaccuracies, incorrect or aberrant master data or data transmission and make analysis impossible. To address this issue efficiently, we propose a two-stage anomaly detection framework utilizing machine learning algorithms. With this methodology, we identified 22,816 anomalies from a total of 1,994,170 prescriptions in cattle (1.1%). Random Forest achieved a ROC-AUC score of 0.994, (95% CI: 0.992, 0.995) and a F1-Score of 0.962 (95% CI: 0.958, 0.966) for single treatments. If applied regularly to uploaded prescriptions, it should reduce input errors over time, improving the validity of the data in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am grateful for the support and guidance of my mentor and colleagues, and I hope that this research will inspire further exploration and innovation with IS ABV. I am happy to share these findings with anyone who is interested and look forward to engaging discussions and collaborations.&lt;/p&gt;

For example, for Swiss farms registered as keeping cattle, a distinction can only be made between milk-producing and non-milk-producing farms. However, a better differentiation of production types would significantly improve the planning and evaluation of cattle disease surveillance.
This study aimed to address this gap by defining five primary cattle production types: calf fattening, dairy cattle, cattle fattening, rearing cattle, and suckler cows. By working with experts and cantonal Veterinary Offices, we collected data from 618 reference farms across 14 cantons and integrated information from three national databases. This allowed us to train machine learning models to classify these production types more accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="anomaly_pic" src="images/pca_farm_types.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Random Forest model stood out with an 𝐚𝐜𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐲 𝐨𝐟 𝟎.𝟗𝟏𝟒 (95% CI: 0.890, 0.938) and an 𝐅𝟏-𝐒𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝟎.𝟖𝟕𝟗 (95% CI: 0.841, 0.913). Our model enables a reproducible, year-to-year classification of Swiss cattle farms, improving the efficiency of disease surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="anomaly_pic" src="images/model_Randomforest_shap_fig.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our methodology is adaptable to other countries and datasets, providing a scalable solution for targeted disease surveillance and perhaps even benchmarking antibiotic use for the benefit of veterinary authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
